**Titanic Survival Analysis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Overview**
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to identify patterns affecting survival rates. The analysis covers gender, age, passenger class, embarkation port, and more, using Python data analysis and visualization libraries.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains details such as:

Passenger class (Pclass)

Name

Sex

Age

Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)

Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)

Ticket fare (Fare)

Cabin

Embarkation port (Embarked)

Survival status (Survived)


**Tools & Libraries**
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

**Key Steps**
Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Converted categorical variables for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Survival rate by gender, age group, passenger class, and embarkation port.

Visualization of age distribution for survivors vs. non-survivors.

Bar charts and histograms for pattern recognition.

**Findings**
Gender: Women had a much higher survival rate than men.

Passenger Class: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Age: Younger passengers had higher survival rates.

Embarkation Port: Some variation in survival by port of embarkation.

**Conclusion**
The analysis of the Titanic dataset revealed strong survival biases toward women, younger passengers, and those in higher classes. This aligns with the "women and children first" evacuation policy of the time. Missing data in Age, Cabin, and Embarked were handled appropriately, ensuring data quality for analysis.
